        <h2>About Our Audience</h2>
        <p><b>Observing Users: </b><br>
            Patricia - originally from Hawai‘i, had a lot of trouble adjusting to the cold weather her Freshman year. She got sick for a
            number of reasons, however, she mentioned that adjusting to the weather was a huge one especially because she had no idea what 
            to wear after living in a tropical climate her whole life. <br>
            <br>
            Mia - originally from Los Angeles, also has trouble with determining what to wear to stay warm when it gets cold. The weather 
            in Oregon is very unpredictable and oftentimes, finds herself rushing in the morning and having little to no time to infer what 
            to wear based on the weather. Her Freshman year was the roughest, especially, having to adjust to a new schedule and lifestyle; 
            figuring out outfits to ensure she stayed warm may be a small thing, but it can completely affect her comfortability and health 
            during the cold months. <br>
            <br>
            
            Maya - originally from Santa Monica, she has an extremely busy schedule juggling classes, work, and extracurricular commitments. 
            Outfit planning takes some time because she must plan for the whole day, and especially living off campus, it’s important to know 
            what is necessary to bring to campus, like a jacket. Especially with the unpredictability of the weather, it can seem like it’ll 
            be a sunny day, but three hours later, rain starts pouring and you’re without a proper rain jacket. 
        </p>
        <p><b>Identifying the Problem:</b><br>
            The problem we are addressing with our website is Weather constantly changes, and during these changes, individuals occasionally 
            remain unaware and make clothing choices that are less than ideal. The objective of this project is to combat this issue by 
            providing daily notifications to users, guiding them on appropriate attire choices corresponding to specific weather conditions. 
            The users will primarily be focused on people new to an area/people who aren’t sure how to dress for the weather. To study our 
            audience, we intend to ask many people what they wear during a specific weather.
        </p>

        <p><b>Developing Personas</b><br></p>
                Patricia
                <li>Age 21</li>
                <li>Senior at WU</li>
                <li>Originally from Waipahu, Hawai‘i</li>
                <li>Not used to the cold weather because of growing up in warm, tropical climates</li>
                <br>
                Mia 
                <li>Age 20</li>
                <li>Senior at WU</li>
                <li>Originally from Los Angeles, California</li>
                <li>Extremely busy with class, thesis, work, and extracurricular activities</li>
        </p>
        <p><b>Illustrating a use case scenario</b><br>  
            Let's take Patricia as an example. Our website simplifies the process—Patricia only requires an email address, which many already have access to, especially through their Willamette Email address. She can then create her own unique nickname, 
            submit both the nickname and email address, and click 'Subscribe.' From there, Patricia will receive daily emails, keeping her informed about the weather and suggesting suitable attire for the day.
        </p>
        <p><b>Finding related products</b><br>  
            There is a website called DailyDressMe (https://dailydressme.com/) in which users can add their current location and the website will give entire outfit suggestions based on the weather for the week. 
            However, the outfits given are tailored to feminine outfits and does not give explicit clothing pieces that a user may need, such as a rain jacket, down jacket, hoodie, coat, leg warmers, boots, etc., which our prototype is hoping to achieve. 
        </p>

        <p><b>Comparing Products: </b><br>  
            While there are weather apps and clothing recommendation apps available, Climate Closet stands out by delivering daily outfit 
            recommendations directly to the user's inbox. These emails not only provide wardrobe suggestions for the day but 
            also bring a positive touch to the user's experience. Furthermore, our website features a user-friendly interface, 
            ensuring easy subscription and unsubscription for all users. Finally, as we continue to develop our website, we will 
            be dedicated to listening to user feedback and continually improving our features based on user input.

        <p><b>Justifying Feasibility:</b><br>
            Our team can fully complete our system by the semester's end. We've identified 
            two critical building blocks: making an accessible and clear website for our intended audience, securely saving 
            emails into a database, and integrating a weather API. With members already having experienced all three of these 
            building blocks, we estimate dedicating 25 hours per member to each of these roles. Our collaborative approach 
            ensures each team member specializes in their role, maximizing efficiency. This allocation of time and our 
            collective experience make us confident in achieving our project goals within the given timeframe.

            <image src = "prototype_1.png" width = full height = 500 style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></image>
            <p>Here is our first prototype. Some important functionalities of this prototype is that there is a subscribe button with a nickname and email for personalization.
                There is then a wardrobe button that shows a dictionary of all of our clothing and what they are used for.
                Finally, there is the wardrobe of the day, which tells the user of the expected weather and what they should wear for today.
            </p>
            <br>
            <image src = "prototype_2.png" width = full height = 500 style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></image>
            <p>
                Here is our second prototype. which still has our email,
                but we now included a "Help" button on the top right to help inform users of our product.
                We also added a forecast, which shows what the weather will be like and what a person should wear 
                for the following days.
                Finally, we added a feedback section with faces that represent how a user may feel in hopes to gain an understanding of how our users feel.

            <image src = "prototype_4.png" width = full height = 500 style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></image>
            <p>
                Our third prototype we decided to bring back the wardrobe button, and display the wardrobe at the 
                bottom of our page. We also have an email of the day which shows the user what they will be expecting when they subscribe to our product. 
                Finally, we kept the forecast as others would be familiar with this layout as it is similar to your typical weather app.

            <p><b>Usability goals and benchmark tasks</b></p>
            <p>Usability Goal 1: The User should be able to figure out how to subscribe by looking at our website.
            </p>
            <p>Task 1: We will show a potential user a prototype of each of the designs and ask them how they would subscribe.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Usability Goal 2: The User should be able to figure out how to unsubscribe by looking at our website or the email.
            </p>
            <p>Task 2: We will show a potential user a prototype of each of the designs and a prototype of an email and ask them how they would unsubscribe.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Usability Goal 1: The User should be able to figure out what to wear that they have by looking through our website.
            </p>
            <p>Task 1: We will show a potential user a weather cycle along with a prototype of the site and 
                ask what they would wear after looking at our website and if they have those clothes in their closet.

        <p><b>Prototype Implementation</b></p>
        <a href="https://weatherwear-one.vercel.app/">Climate Closet</a>
        <p>The primary and most significant feature of this website is the ability for users to subscribe to our application, which we have incorporated here. This enables them to receive notifications as soon as the messaging system is completed</p>

        <p><b>User manual or installation guide</b></p>
        <p>1. First, the user will go to our webpage:</p>
        <a href="https://weatherwear-one.vercel.app/">Climate Closet</a>
        <p>2. Upon entering the webpage, the user will be greeted with text and an input for nickname and email address</p>
        <image src="manuscript_1.png" width = full height = 500></image>
        <p>3. The user then provides their Nickname and Email Address to the inputs and press subscribe. Note that the user must have both fields filled in to register.</p>
        <image src="manuscript_2.png" width = full height = 500></image>
        <image src="manuscript_3.png" width = full height = 300></image>
        <p>4. After this, the user will wait until tomorrow morning to be greeted by an email about the weather and a clothing recommendation</p>
        <p>Although still unclear on the website, the user can go to one of the emails sent to them, go to the bottom of those emails, and there will be a link/button to unsubscribe. The user can alternatively block the email.</p>
        
        <p><b>User population</b></p>
        <p>The target audience consists of residents of Salem, Oregon, who wish to receive weather updates and guidance on clothing choices for various weather conditions. More specifically, this resource is tailored for individuals at Willamette University who have recently transferred, as they may particularly benefit from its utility</p>
        <p><b>Usability goals</b></p>
        <p>Some key usability goals that need to be tested during the development of this application are:</p>
        <p>The Ease of Subscription and Unsubscription - We want to know if users can subscribe and unsubscribe easily and if they can identify where these buttons are located.</p>
            
        <p>Data Forecast Accuracy - Can users quickly find the daily weather forecast? We also want to know if these forecasts are accurate for the day.</p>
            
        <p>Notification Delivery - Are notifications delivered reliably and on time each morning?</p>
            
        <p>Content Clarity and Readability - Are the emails and forecasts easily readable and understandable?</p>
            
        <p>Personalization - Is the username being displayed correctly in their email?</p>
            
        <p>Feedback Mechanism - Is the feedback easily accessible? Does it ask the right questions?</p>
        <p><b>Usability test procedure</b></p>
        <p>There should be 1-3 examiners</p>
        <p>The examiners will need a computer with access to the internet to show the website and should be subscribed to the email so they can show the user a sample email. If they forgot or don’t have the opportunity to discord message Aaron and he can send you the email for the day.
            There is a manual earlier on this page that describes how to navigate the website.</p>
        <p>The examiners should treat the test subjects normally in no special way. Once they ask the questions and the tests they should let the subject do the talking and if there is no feedback record that and move on to the next question.</p>
        <p>The examiners should avoid doing the tasks for the subject unless they are extremely confused</p>
        <p>The examiners should measure the speed with which the user completes each task. It doesn’t have to be exact, but it can be on the scale(Quick, Somewhat Quickly, Somewhat Slowly, Slow). After the task, the examiner should comment on how the subject responded to the website over-all(it might be helpful to describe how good the person is with technology)</p>
        <p><b>Usability Evaluation</b></p>
        <p>To begin the usability evaluation the examiner should have the website open on their computer.
            The examiner should show the test subject the website and begin with:</p>
        <p>Q1: Looking at this page and tell me what you would do to subscribe to this page.</p>
        <p>Q2: Do you trust this website on a scale of 1-5, 5 being Absolutely, and 1 being Not at All.</p>
        <p>Q3: Show the test subject an example email and ask them what they would wear on that day.</p>
        <p>Q4: In the example email, ask the user what they would do to unsubscribe to the page.</p>
            
        <p><b>Results and Analysis</b></p>
        <p>We conducted user testing, actively gathering insights through observations and feedback. One participant expressed, "The website is very simple with no issues," giving a high usability rating and nothing further to add. 
        </p>
        <p>Another user found the site to be straightforward and user-friendly but suggested improvements in design, noting it felt somewhat empty. Despite the positive usability rating, this user expressed hesitation about signing up for our application.
        </p>
        <p>Our third user noted that the weather wasn't accurate to google's weather data, after presenting to the user that the website's weather actually is from 7 am - 10 pm, they understood. They said the functions seemed to work as well, but unsubscribing had some errors at times.</p>
        <p>Our fourth user asked if this was strictly weather for Salem, Oregon. We replied yes, and they suggested to make this clear to all users in case someone outside of Salem visits it.</p>
        <p>Finally our fifth user didn't give much feedback, signing up and unsubscribing seemed easy to them and they said they liked the pictures.</p>
        <p>For question number 2 the overall total was 21 with the highest score being a 5 and the lowest being a 2 and an average of 4.2 per subject. The comments with trustability 
        where mostly just having to do with the style of the website being mostly text.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Overall, from the tests we have conducted, it seems that the functions work as expected, but the design needs more work as we need to specifcy to users where the weather is located, what times the weather is being parsed and finally fixing the unsubsribe feature.
