        <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
        <p><b> For Justifying Feasibility:</b><br>
            Our team can fully complete our system by the semester's end. We've identified 
            two critical building blocks: making an accessible and clear website for our intended audience, securely saving 
            emails into a database, and integrating a weather API. With members already having experienced all three of these 
            building blocks, we estimate dedicating 25 hours per member to each of these roles. Our collaborative approach 
            ensures each team member specializes in their role, maximizing efficiency. This allocation of time and our 
            collective experience make us confident in achieving our project goals within the given timeframe. 
        </p>
        <p><b>For Comparing Products: </b><br>  
            While there are weather apps and clothing recommendation apps available, Climate Closet stands out by delivering daily outfit 
            recommendations directly to the user's inbox. These emails not only provide wardrobe suggestions for the day but 
            also bring a positive touch to the user's experience. Furthermore, our website features a user-friendly interface, 
            ensuring easy subscription and unsubscription for all users. Finally, as we continue to develop our website, we will 
            be dedicated to listening to user feedback and continually improving our features based on user input.

        <h2>About Our Audience</h2>
        <p><b>For Observing Users: </b><br>
            Patricia - originally from Hawai‘i, had a lot of trouble adjusting to the cold weather her Freshman year. She got sick for a
            number of reasons, however, she mentioned that adjusting to the weather was a huge one especially because she had no idea what 
            to wear after living in a tropical climate her whole life. <br>
            Mia - originally from Los Angeles, also has trouble with determining what to wear to stay warm when it gets cold. The weather 
            in Oregon is very unpredictable and oftentimes, finds herself rushing in the morning and having little to no time to infer what 
            to wear based on the weather. Her Freshman year was the roughest, especially, having to adjust to a new schedule and lifestyle; 
            figuring out outfits to ensure she stayed warm may be a small thing, but it can completely affect her comfortability and health 
            during the cold months. <br>
            Maya - originally from Santa Monica, she has an extremely busy schedule juggling classes, work, and extracurricular commitments. 
            Outfit planning takes some time because she must plan for the whole day, and especially living off campus, it’s important to know 
            what is necessary to bring to campus, like a jacket. Especially with the unpredictability of the weather, it can seem like it’ll 
            be a sunny day, but three hours later, rain starts pouring and you’re without a proper rain jacket. 
        </p>
        <p><b>For Identifying the Problem:</b><br>
            The problem we are addressing with our website is Weather constantly changes, and during these changes, individuals occasionally 
            remain unaware and make clothing choices that are less than ideal. The objective of this project is to combat this issue by 
            providing daily notifications to users, guiding them on appropriate attire choices corresponding to specific weather conditions. 
            The users will primarily be focused on people new to an area/people who aren’t sure how to dress for the weather. To study our 
            audience, we intend to ask many people what they wear during a specific weather.
